-- Handle save game loading (on_load())
-- It gives the mod the opportunity to rectify potential differences in local state introduced by the save/load cycle.
-- Access to the game object is not available.
-- The storage table can be accessed and is safe to read from, but not write to, as doing so will lead to an error.
-- The only legitimate uses of this step are these:
-- - Re-setup metatables not registered with LuaBootstrap::register_metatable, as they are not persisted through the save/load cycle.
-- - Re-setup conditional event handlers, meaning subscribing to an event only when some condition is met to save processing time.
-- - Create local references to data stored in the storage table.
-- For all other purposes, LuaBootstrap::on_init, LuaBootstrap::on_configuration_changed, or migrations should be used instead.
-- no events will be raised for a mod it has finished on_init() or on_load()
-- storage is persisted between loaded games, but local variables that hook into storage need to be setup here
