## Project Overview

This is a Factorio mod called "Quality Control" that automatically changes machine quality over time based on manufacturing hours. The mod tracks how long machines have been producing items and applies quality upgrades or downgrades based on configurable settings.

## Engineering Principles

Keep code clear to understand for other engineers. Clarity is more important than brevity or clever solutions.

Correct use of factorio's API is vital; it's very important to validate assumptions about the API because it changes over time.

The API documentation is available via context7 with this library ID: "context7/lua-api_factorio-stable"
