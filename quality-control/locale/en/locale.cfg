[mod-setting-description]
manufacturing-minutes-for-change=The minutes of work required for an assembler to generate an upgrade credit. Minutes only accrue when actively producing items.\nMin value 1 minute\nMax value 1440 minutes (24 hours).
percentage-chance-of-change=The percentage chance that a quality change will be successful.\nMin value 0.0001%, Max value 100% (always change after the time is passed)
quality-increase-cost=This increases the time between change attempts per level of quality. This is a compounding formula. Setting to 0% will keep the time between attempts the same no matter the quality level\n\n[color=green]Example with 3 manufacturing hours needed at 50% cost per level[/color]\n\nNormal: 3 hours\nUncommon: 4.5 hours\nRare: 6.8 hours\nEpic: 10.1 hours\nLegendary: 15.2 hours\nModded quality lvl 10: 173 hours
quality-chance-accumulation-rate=Controls how much the chance increases after each failed attempt.\n\n[color=white]None (Default):[/color] No accumulation - chance stays constant.\n\n[color=white]Low (20%):[/color] Chance increases by 20% of base rate each failure.\n\n[color=white]Medium (50%):[/color] Chance increases by 50% of base rate each failure.\n\n[color=white]High (100%):[/color] Chance increases by 100% of base rate each failure.\n\n[color=yellow]Example with 1% base chance:[/color]\n\n[color=white]Low:[/color] 1.0% → 1.2% → 1.4% → 1.6%...\n[color=white]High:[/color] 1.0% → 2.0% → 3.0% → 4.0%...\n\nAll accumulation settings eventually guarantee quality changes - higher settings just reach 100% chance faster
change-modules-with-entity=This controls whether modules in machines are affected by quality changes.\n\n[color=white]Disabled (Default):[/color] Modules are not affected when the quality of the host machine changes.\n\n[color=white]Enabled:[/color] Modules change quality by one tier when their host changes. They will not exceed the host's quality level.\n\n[color=white]Extra Enabled:[/color] Like Enabled, but modules will be updated matched to their host machine's quality anytime a quality change occurs.
batch-entities-per-tick=Number of entities to process each tick to avoid performance spikes.\nMin value 1, Max value 1000.\nHigher values may cause lag spikes but process entities faster.
batch-ticks-between-processing=Number of ticks to wait between batch processing cycles.\nMin value 1 tick, Max value 6000 ticks (~2.5 minutes).\nLower values process more frequently but may impact performance.
quality-change-aggregate-alerts-enabled=Show console messages summarizing all quality changes. Example: "3 assembly machines upgraded, 2 inserters upgraded"
aggregate-notification-cooldown-minutes=How often to display the aggregate summary message in minutes.\nMin value 1 minute, Max value 720 minutes (12 hours).
quality-change-entity-alerts-enabled=Show map ping alerts on individual entities when their quality changes. Click the alert to view the upgraded entity.
enable-accumulators=Enable quality changes for accumulators.
enable-agricultural-towers=Enable quality changes for agricultural towers.
enable-assembly-machines=Enable quality changes for assembly machines.
enable-asteroid-collectors=Enable quality changes for asteroid collectors.
enable-beacons=Enable quality changes for beacons.
enable-boilers=Enable quality changes for boilers.
enable-combinators-and-speakers=Enable quality changes for combinators and speakers.\n\nIncludes: arithmetic combinators, decider combinators, constant combinators, programmable speakers.
enable-pumps=Enable quality changes for pumps (includes offshore pumps and fluid pumps).
enable-furnaces=Enable quality changes for furnaces.
enable-generators=Enable quality changes for generators (steam engines, steam turbines).
enable-heat-pipes=Enable quality changes for heat pipes.
enable-inserters=Enable quality changes for inserters.
enable-labs=Enable quality changes for research laboratories.
enable-lamps=Enable quality changes for lamps.
enable-lightning-rods=Enable quality changes for lightning rods.
enable-mining-drills=Enable quality changes for all mining drills.
enable-poles=Enable quality changes for all electric poles (including big power poles and substations).
enable-power-switches=Enable quality changes for power switches.
enable-radar=Enable quality changes for radar stations.
radar-growth-level-limit=Limits radar quality growth in order to prevent excessive map exploration and save file bloat.\n\nRadars with very high quality levels can cause large save files (1,200mb+) due to excessive map exploration.\n\n[color=green]Default: level 5 (legendary)[/color]\n[color=yellow]Range: 1-255 quality levels[/color]
lightning-attractor-growth-level-limit=Limits lightning attractor quality growth to prevent performance issues.\n\nLightning attractors with very high quality levels have significantly increased coverage areas, which can cause lag spikes at night on Fulgora.\n\n[color=green]Default: level 5 (legendary)[/color]\n[color=yellow]Range: 1-255 quality levels[/color]
enable-reactors=Enable quality changes for nuclear reactors.
enable-roboports=Enable quality changes for roboports.
enable-solar-panels=Enable quality changes for solar panels.
enable-thrusters=Enable quality changes for space thrusters.
enable-turrets=Enable quality changes for turrets.\n\nIncludes: ammo turrets, laser turrets, flamethrowers, artillery turrets.
enable-defense-walls-and-gates=Enable quality changes for walls and gates.\n\nIncludes: walls, gates.
