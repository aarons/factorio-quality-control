# factorio-quality-control

This mod changes the quality of machines after a certain amount of processing.

Use ./package.sh to package it up into a zip file, for testing changes locally. You will need to copy that zip to your local factorio mods folder.


## Todo

- include other entities that process items, such as labs and miners
- figure out balanced and sane defaults for the settings
