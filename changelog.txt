Version: 1.0.2
Date: 15. 08. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an issue with secondary entity rate tracking that could apply quality updates too frequently
  Ease of use:
    - Added tests and validation scripts for mod authors and contributors
    - Quality-control-init command now preserves existing machine progress instead of resetting to zero
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 13. 08. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed secondary entity quality change rate being affected by processing frequency
    - Secondary entities now upgrade at consistent rates regardless of batch processing interval
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 11. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Prevent console alert spam by adding notification throttling with cooldown (the console alert is off by default)
  Optimizations:
    - Improved performance by adding configurable batch processing
    - Reduced total tracked entities by removing those that cannot change quality
    - Reduced memory usage by implementing exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) for secondary entity upgrade attempts
  Bugfixes:
    - Prevent double upgrades when re-initializing cached storage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.0
Date: 10. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Added settings to customize which entities are affected by quality changes
    - Added options to allow modules to progress alongside their host entities
  Balancing:
    - Added option to have modules move only one quality tier at a time
  Ease of use:
    - Added comprehensive tooltips explaining entity types and balance considerations for all settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.0
Date: 09. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Modules now automatically upgrade to match entity quality during quality changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0
Date: 07. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Expanded tracked entity types to include Space Age content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0
Date: 04. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Split notifications into two independently configurable types:
      - Aggregate console alerts showing summary of all changes per tick
      - Individual entity map ping alerts for each quality change
    - Enhanced stability with automatic storage reinitialization
    - Added entity validation and error recovery mechanisms
  Optimizations:
    - Reduced memory overhead and improved predictability of entity tracking
    - Refactored entity type checking to improve maintainability
  Bugfixes:
    - Improved handling of invalid entities during quality checks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 03. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Apply quality changes to secondary entities
    - Expanded entity tracking to include more placeable types (except belts, pipes, and tiles as they impacted performance too much)
    - Added entity inspection tool and cache re-initialization command
  Optimizations:
    - Replaced periodic entity scan with event-based tracking - eliminated expensive find_entities_filtered calls from the main quality-check loop by maintaining a cached list updated via creation/destruction events (major performance improvement on large maps)
    - Consolidated scattered entity type definitions into a single hardcoded lookup table with O(1) performance, replacing multiple inline table definitions
    - Refined quality change distribution logic to process all accumulated upgrade attempts per cycle instead of just one
  Bugfixes:
    - Reset internal state on configuration change
    - Restricted manufacturing hour tracking to assemblers and furnaces only
    - Fixed quality processing to handle all accumulated upgrade attempts per cycle
    - Fixed "qaulity" typo in setting and variable names
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 02. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Added accumulating chance for quality upgrades
  Optimizations:
    - Removed redundant storage initialization checks that were being performed multiple times per tick
    - Simplified quality control logic by eliminating unnecessary state variables and streamlining the upgrade/downgrade decision flow
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 01. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Extended quality control to inserter, pump, radar, and roboport
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 31. 07. 2025
  Features:
    - Implemented periodic checks based on manufacturing hours
    - Added quality control support for labs and mining drills
    - Added player notifications for machine quality changes
    - Added optional console messages for quality changes
  Optimizations:
    - Return quality name string directly instead of full prototype object when determining next quality level (reduced memory usage and lookup overhead)
    - Improved machine data cleanup efficiency by replacing periodic full-scan cleanup with instant event-driven removal on entity destruction (on_entity_died, on_player_mined_entity, on_robot_mined_entity)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 30. 07. 2025
  Features:
    - Initial implementation of quality tracking system for machines
    - Automatic quality upgrades and downgrades based on manufacturing hours
    - Configurable upgrade timing and direction settings
    - Support for assembling machines and furnaces
