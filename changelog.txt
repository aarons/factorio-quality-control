  Modding:
    - Excludes entities from ammo-loader mod to prevent compatibility issues
    - Adds data migration to fix broken ammo-loader entities that may have been upgraded
      before the exclusion was added.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.4
Date: 19. 08. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed issue where entity properties were accessed after script.raise_script_destroy. Thank you Smougtea (again!!)
  Modding:
    - Excludes entities that didn't upgrade well from:
      ControlTech updated for Factorio 2
      Circuit-Controlled Routers
      Bulk Rail Loader 2.0 Temporary Patch
      Thank you Sangrias for the excellent save file that helped identify these!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.3
Date: 19. 08. 2025
  Modding:
    - Excludes entities from Realistic Reactors Reborn mod to prevent issues
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 18. 08. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when entities become invalid during quality processing. Thank you Smougtea for reporting!
  Modding:
    - Excludes entities from mods that add non-upgradeable items (Warp-Drive-Machine, quality-condenser)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 18. 08. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash caused by debug statements accessing invalid entity properties. Even though
      debugging was turned off, LUA still evaluated the arguments with the way it was setup.
      Thanks to MrSilver2510 for the bug report!
    - Removed all debug statements until a safer approach can be implemented.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 17. 08. 2025
  Balancing:
    - Improved upgrade system for secondary entities to provide more consistent progression.
      It should feel more reliable and slightly more frequent. They now receive guaranteed
      upgrade attempts proportional to the ratio of secondary to primary entities. Previously
      the mod used a per-unit-per-tick-percentage-chance that decayed over time, which was too
      difficult to tune properly. This system is simpler and more consistent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.3
Date: 16. 08. 2025
  Optimizations:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
Date: 16. 08. 2025

    - Fixed a crash when entity cloning fails during cross-mod interactions (Thank you Stargateur!!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 15. 08. 2025

    - Fixed the hotkey for entity inspection (Control+Shift+Q)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ease of use:
    - Clarified aggregate notification setting to indicate 5-minute display frequency
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 15. 08. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an issue with secondary entity rate tracking that could apply updates too frequently
  Ease of use:
    - Added tests and validation scripts for mod authors and contributors
    - The quality-control-init command now preserves machine progress instead of resetting it to zero
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 13. 08. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an issue with the secondary entity change rate being affected by ticks between processing
    - Secondary entities now upgrade at consistent rates regardless of batch processing interval
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 11. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Prevent console alert spam by adding notification throttling with cooldown (the console alert is off by default)
  Optimizations:
    - Improved performance by adding configurable batch processing
    - Reduced total tracked entities by removing those that cannot change quality
    - Reduced memory usage by implementing exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) for secondary entity upgrade attempts
  Bugfixes:
    - Prevent double upgrades when re-initializing cached storage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.0
Date: 10. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Added settings to customize which entities are affected by quality changes
    - Added options to allow modules to progress alongside their host entities
  Balancing:
    - Added option to have modules move only one quality tier at a time
  Ease of use:
    - Added comprehensive tooltips explaining entity types and balance considerations for all settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.0
Date: 09. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Modules now automatically upgrade to match entity quality during quality changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0
Date: 07. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Expanded tracked entity types to include Space Age content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0
Date: 04. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Split notifications into two independently configurable types:
      - Aggregate console alerts showing summary of all changes per tick
      - Individual entity map ping alerts for each quality change
    - Enhanced stability with automatic storage reinitialization
    - Added entity validation and error recovery mechanisms
  Optimizations:
    - Reduced memory overhead and improved predictability of entity tracking
    - Refactored entity type checking to improve maintainability
  Bugfixes:
    - Improved handling of invalid entities during quality checks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 03. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Apply quality changes to secondary entities
    - Expanded entity tracking to include more placeable types (except belts, pipes, and tiles as they impacted performance too much)
    - Added entity inspection tool and cache re-initialization command
  Optimizations:
    - Replaced periodic entity scan with event-based tracking - eliminated expensive find_entities_filtered calls from the main quality-check loop by maintaining a cached list updated via creation/destruction events (major performance improvement on large maps)
    - Consolidated scattered entity type definitions into a single hardcoded lookup table with O(1) performance, replacing multiple inline table definitions
    - Refined quality change distribution logic to process all accumulated upgrade attempts per cycle instead of just one
  Bugfixes:
    - Reset internal state on configuration change
    - Restricted manufacturing hour tracking to assemblers and furnaces only
    - Fixed quality processing to handle all accumulated upgrade attempts per cycle
    - Fixed "qaulity" typo in setting and variable names
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 02. 08. 2025
  Features:
    - Added accumulating chance for quality upgrades
  Optimizations:
    - Removed redundant storage initialization checks that were being performed multiple times per tick
    - Simplified quality control logic by eliminating unnecessary state variables and streamlining the upgrade/downgrade decision flow
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 01. 08. 2025

  Features:
    - Implemented periodic checks based on manufacturing hours
    - Added quality control support for labs and mining drills
    - Added player notifications for machine quality changes
    - Added optional console messages for quality changes
  Optimizations:
    - Return quality name string directly instead of full prototype object when determining next quality level (reduced memory usage and lookup overhead)
    - Improved machine data cleanup efficiency by replacing periodic full-scan cleanup with instant event-driven removal on entity destruction (on_entity_died, on_player_mined_entity, on_robot_mined_entity)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 30. 07. 2025
