Please add a new changelog entry with context about our latest work. Be sure to also update the version in `info.json`.

The changelog should only contain details that are relevant to players and users of the mod; it should not contain details specific to the development process or repo management.

Important Guidelines

- Entries must map to an official factorio category.
- Use simple, clear language that focuses on the user benefit rather than technical implementation details
- Don't include low level details that are only specific to our mod, such as internal variable names, file structure changes, etc.
- Use positive, forward-looking language that describes what the changes accomplish.
- Prefer algorithmic descriptions over code-specific or internal terms ("algorithm" vs "validation function")

Examples:
- Good: "Optimized search algorithm by using hash tables instead of linear scanning"
- Less good: "Improved performance of should_exclude_entity() by replacing array iteration with direct table lookup"

Iterate a few times to come up with the clearest message. This changelog is important for representing our work.
