difficulty=Controls which direction the quality of an entity placed in the world will change over time.\n\n[color=white]Common:[/color] Quality is always upgraded\n[color=green]Uncommon:[/color] Quality is usually upgraded (75% chance), sometimes downgraded (25% chance)\n[color=blue]Rare:[/color] Randomly upgraded or downgraded (50/50 chance)\n[color=purple]Epic:[/color] Usually downgraded (75% chance), sometimes upgraded (25% chance)\n[color=yellow]Legendary:[/color] Always downgraded
manufacturing-hours-for-change=This sets the hours of work a crafting machine needs to do in order to trigger a possible quality change.\n\nThe default setting of 1 hour means that an Assembler with crafting speed of 1 that's working full time will will have it's quality tested once an hour. Idle machines don't accumulate hours.\n\nFaster assemblers (higher tier and beaconed) will accumulate hours more quickly. An assembler with crafting speed 10 will have it's quality tested 10x more frequently.\n\nMin value 0.01 hours (36 seconds of work required)\nMax value 100 hours (will need a big base or fast assemblers to notice changes)
percentage-chance-of-change=This is the chance that a quality change will occur when an entity is tested.\n\n[color=white]Default 1%:[/color] changes are rare but will slowly occur during normal play. At 1% it will take 69 attempts to change the quality of a machine on average.\n\nHere are some examples of how a 1% chance will impact gameplay with 1 hour of work needed:\n\n[color=green]Early Game at 1%[/color]\n\nA Common Assembler 1 (speed 0.5) making items continuously will accrue 1 manufacturing hour for 2 hours of gameplay. So on average will update after ~140 hours of gameplay. Or another way to look at it is that 140 Assembler 1's will have one machine update for every hour of gameplay.\n\nA Common Assembler 3 (speed 1.25) will have a chance to change every 48 minutes of gameplay, and on average update after 34 hours.\n\n[color=blue]Mid Game at 1%[/color]\n\nA Common Assembler 3 with Speed 2 modules and 2 beacons has a chance to change every 14 minutes, and on average will update after 16 hours of gameplay.\n\n[color=purple]Late Game at 1%[/color]\n\nAn Epic Foundry with rare speed 3 modules and 4 rare beacons will have a crafting speed of 78.1. It has a chance to change quality after just 48 seconds. On average it will update after 54 minutes of gameplay.
quality-chance-accumulation-rate=Controls if chance to change will increase after a failed attempt.\n\n[color=white]None (Default):[/color] No accumulation - chance stays constant.\n\n[color=white]Low (20%):[/color] Chance increases by 20% of base rate after each failure.\n\n[color=white]Medium (50%):[/color] Chance increases by 50% of base rate after each failure.\n\n[color=white]High (100%):[/color] Chance increases by 100% of base rate after each failure.\n\n[color=yellow]Example with 1% base chance:[/color]\n\n[color=white]Low:[/color] 1.0% → 1.2% → 1.4% → 1.6%...\n[color=white]High:[/color] 1.0% → 2.0% → 3.0% → 4.0%...\n\nAll accumulation settings eventually guarantee quality changes - higher settings just reach 100% chance faster.
quality-increase-cost=Increases the hours required to change for each level of quality. Higher quality machines will change less often. The cost compounds at each level. The formula is: Base Hours × (1 + modifier)^quality_level. Level 0 (Normal) is never modified.\n\n[color=yellow]Examples with 5 'Manufacturing Hours for Change':[/color]\n\n[color=white]Modifier: 0.0 (no increase)[/color]\n  Normal (Lvl 0): 5.0 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 1): 5.0 Hours\n  Rare (Lvl 2): 5.0 Hours\n\n[color=white]Modifier: 0.3 (30% compound increase)[/color]\n  Normal (Lvl 0): 5.0 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 1): 6.5 Hours\n  Rare (Lvl 2): 8.5 Hours\n\n[color=white]Modifier: 1.0 (100% compound increase)[/color]\n  Normal (Lvl 0): 5.0 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 1): 10.0 Hours\n  Rare (Lvl 2): 20.0 Hours
upgrade-check-frequency-seconds=How often to check for quality changes in seconds.\nMin value 1 second, Max value 3600 seconds (60 minutes).\nFor large bases, lower values can may impact performance.
quality-change-aggregate-alerts-enabled=Show console messages summarizing all quality changes made during a tick. Example: "3 assembly machines upgraded, 1 inserter downgraded"
quality-change-entity-alerts-enabled=Show map ping alerts on individual entities when their quality changes. Click the alert to view the upgraded entity.
