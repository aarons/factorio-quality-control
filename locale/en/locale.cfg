[mod-setting-description]
quality-change-direction=Whether the quality of machines should increase or decrease over time.
manufacturing-hours-for-change=The number of manufacturing hours after which a quality change can happen.\nManufacturing hours are determined by the number of items crafted multiplied by the recipe duration.\nMin value 0.001 hours (3.6 seconds), Max value 1000 hours.
percentage-chance-of-change=The percentage chance that a quality change will occur after the manufacturing hours are met.\nMin value 0.0001%, Max value 100% (always change after the time is passed)
quality-level-modifier=Multiplies the manufacturing hours needed for each quality level by this amount. A value of 0 means all quality levels have an equal chance of changing.\n\n[color=yellow]Example based on 10 'Manufacturing Hours for Change':[/color]\n\n[u]Modifier: 0[/u]\n  Common (Lvl 1): 10 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 2): 10 Hours\n  Legendary (Lvl 5): 10 Hours\n\n[u]Modifier: 1[/u]\n  Common (Lvl 1): 10 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 2): 20 Hours\n  Legendary (Lvl 5): 50 Hours\n\n[u]Modifier: 2[/u]\n  Common (Lvl 1): 10 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 2): 30 Hours\n  Legendary (Lvl 5): 90 Hours
upgrade-check-frequency-seconds=How often to check all machines for quality upgrades in seconds.\nMin value 1 second, Max value 3600 seconds (60 minutes).\nLower values check more frequently but may impact performance.
