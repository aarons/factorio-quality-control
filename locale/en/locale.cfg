quality-change-direction=Quality Change Direction
manufacturing-hours-for-change=Manufacturing Hours for Change
percentage-chance-of-change=Percentage Chance of Change

[mod-setting-description]
quality-change-direction=Whether the quality of machines should increase or decrease over time.
manufacturing-hours-for-change=The number of manufacturing hours after which a quality change can happen.\nManufacturing hours are determined by the number of items crafted multiplied by the recipe duration.\nMin value 0.001 hours (3.6 seconds), Max value 1000 hours.
percentage-chance-of-change=The percentage chance that a quality change will occur after the manufacturing hours are met.\nMin value 0.0001%, Max value 100% (always change after the time is passed)
quality-level-modifier=Acts like an interest rate that compounds at each quality level. The formula is: Base Hours Ã— (1 + modifier)^quality_level. Level 0 (Normal) is never modified.\n\n[color=yellow]Examples with 5 'Manufacturing Hours for Change':[/color]\n\n[color=white]Modifier: 0.0 (no increase)[/color]\n  Normal (Lvl 0): 5.0 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 1): 5.0 Hours\n  Rare (Lvl 2): 5.0 Hours\n\n[color=white]Modifier: 0.3 (30% compound increase)[/color]\n  Normal (Lvl 0): 5.0 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 1): 6.5 Hours\n  Rare (Lvl 2): 8.5 Hours\n\n[color=white]Modifier: 1.0 (100% compound increase)[/color]\n  Normal (Lvl 0): 5.0 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 1): 10.0 Hours\n  Rare (Lvl 2): 20.0 Hours
upgrade-check-frequency-seconds=How often to check all machines for quality upgrades in seconds.\nMin value 1 second, Max value 3600 seconds (60 minutes).\nLower values check more frequently but may impact performance.
