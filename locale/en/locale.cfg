[mod-setting-description]
quality-change-direction=Whether the quality of machines should increase or decrease over time.
manufacturing-hours-for-change=The number of manufacturing hours required for a quality change to be attempted.\nManufacturing hours are determined by the number of items crafted multiplied by the recipe duration.\nMin value 0.001 hours (3.6 seconds), Max value 1000 hours.
percentage-chance-of-change=The percentage chance that a quality change will be successful.\nMin value 0.0001%, Max value 100% (always change after the time is passed)
quality-increase-cost=This increases the time between change attempts per level of quality. This is a compounding formula. Setting to 0% will keep the time between attempts the same no matter the quality level\n\n[color=green]Example with 3 manufacturing hours needed at 50% cost per level[/color]\n\nNormal: 3 hours\nUncommon: 4.5 hours\nRare: 6.8 hours\nEpic: 10.1 hours\nLegendary: 15.2 hours\nModded quality lvl 10: 173 hours
quality-chance-accumulation-rate=Controls how much the chance increases after each failed attempt.\n\n[color=white]None (Default):[/color] No accumulation - chance stays constant.\n\n[color=white]Low (20%):[/color] Chance increases by 20% of base rate each failure.\n\n[color=white]Medium (50%):[/color] Chance increases by 50% of base rate each failure.\n\n[color=white]High (100%):[/color] Chance increases by 100% of base rate each failure.\n\n[color=yellow]Example with 1% base chance:[/color]\n\n[color=white]Low:[/color] 1.0% → 1.2% → 1.4% → 1.6%...\n[color=white]High:[/color] 1.0% → 2.0% → 3.0% → 4.0%...\n\nAll accumulation settings eventually guarantee quality changes - higher settings just reach 100% chance faster
change-modules-with-entity=This controls whether modules in machines are affected by quality changes.\n\n[color=white]Disabled (Default):[/color] Modules are not affected when the quality of the host machine changes.\n\n[color=white]Enabled:[/color] Modules change quality by one tier when their host changes. They will not exceed the host's quality level.\n\n[color=white]Extra Enabled:[/color] Like Enabled, but modules will be updated matched to their host machine's quality anytime a quality change occurs.
batch-entities-per-tick=Number of entities to process each tick to avoid performance spikes.\nMin value 1, Max value 1000.\nHigher values may cause lag spikes but process entities faster.
batch-ticks-between-processing=Number of ticks to wait between batch processing cycles.\nMin value 1 tick, Max value 6000 ticks (~2.5 minutes).\nLower values process more frequently but may impact performance.
quality-change-aggregate-alerts-enabled=Show console messages summarizing all quality changes (displayed once every 5 minutes). Example: "3 assembly machines upgraded, 1 inserter downgraded"
quality-change-entity-alerts-enabled=Show map ping alerts on individual entities when their quality changes. Click the alert to view the upgraded entity.
primary-entities-selection=Controls which primary entities govern quality change rates. These entities drive the manufacturing hours that affect all other entity types.\n\n[color=yellow]At least one primary entity type must be enabled for the mod to function.[/color]\n\nAssembly machines and furnaces accumulate manufacturing hours through crafting recipes, which then influences quality changes for all enabled secondary entities.
enable-electrical-entities=Enable quality changes for electrical infrastructure.\n\nIncludes: electric poles, solar panels, accumulators, generators, reactors, boilers, heat pipes, power switches, lightning rods.
enable-other-production-entities=Enable quality changes for other production entities.\n\nIncludes: agricultural towers, mining drills, rocket silos.
enable-defense-entities=Enable quality changes for defense structures.\n\nIncludes: turrets, artillery turrets, walls, gates.
enable-space-entities=Enable quality changes for space platform assets.\n\nIncludes: asteroid collectors, thrusters, cargo landing pads.
enable-other-entities=Enable quality changes for miscellaneous items.\n\nIncludes: lamps, combinators (arithmetic, decider, constant), programmable speakers.
enable-labs=Enable quality changes for research laboratories.
enable-roboports=Enable quality changes for roboports (construction and logistic robot bases).
enable-beacons=Enable quality changes for beacons (module effect transmitters).
enable-pumps=Enable quality changes for pumps.\n\nIncludes: offshore pumps and regular fluid pumps.
enable-radar=Enable quality changes for radar stations.
enable-inserters=Enable quality changes for inserters (all types).
