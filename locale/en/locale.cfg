quality-change-direction=Whether the quality of machines should increase or decrease over time.
manufacturing-hours-for-change=The number of manufacturing hours after which a quality change can happen.\nManufacturing hours are determined by the number of items crafted multiplied by the recipe duration.\nMin value 0.001 hours (3.6 seconds), Max value 1000 hours.
percentage-chance-of-change=The percentage chance that a quality change will occur after the manufacturing hours are met.\nMin value 0.0001%, Max value 100% (always change after the time is passed)
qaulity-increase-cost=Increases the cost of changes per level of quality. The cost compounds at each level. The formula is: Base Hours × (1 + modifier)^quality_level. Level 0 (Normal) is never modified.\n\n[color=yellow]Examples with 5 'Manufacturing Hours for Change':[/color]\n\n[color=white]Modifier: 0.0 (no increase)[/color]\n  Normal (Lvl 0): 5.0 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 1): 5.0 Hours\n  Rare (Lvl 2): 5.0 Hours\n\n[color=white]Modifier: 0.3 (30% compound increase)[/color]\n  Normal (Lvl 0): 5.0 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 1): 6.5 Hours\n  Rare (Lvl 2): 8.5 Hours\n\n[color=white]Modifier: 1.0 (100% compound increase)[/color]\n  Normal (Lvl 0): 5.0 Hours\n  Uncommon (Lvl 1): 10.0 Hours\n  Rare (Lvl 2): 20.0 Hours
quality-chance-accumulation-rate=Controls how much the change chance increases after each failed attempt.\n\n[color=white]None (Default):[/color] No accumulation - chance stays constant.\n\n[color=white]Low (20%):[/color] Chance increases by 20% of base rate each failure.\n\n[color=white]Medium (50%):[/color] Chance increases by 50% of base rate each failure.\n\n[color=white]High (100%):[/color] Chance increases by 100% of base rate each failure.\n\n[color=yellow]Example with 1% base chance:[/color]\n\n[color=white]Low:[/color] 1.0% → 1.2% → 1.4% → 1.6%...\n[color=white]High:[/color] 1.0% → 2.0% → 3.0% → 4.0%...\n\nAll accumulation settings eventually guarantee quality changes - higher settings just reach 100% chance faster.
upgrade-check-frequency-seconds=How often to check all machines for quality upgrades in seconds.\nMin value 1 second, Max value 3600 seconds (60 minutes).\nLower values check more frequently but may impact performance.
quality-change-alerts-enabled=Show an alert on the map when the quality is changed for a machine.
quality-change-console-messages-enabled=Show a console message when the quality is changed for a machine.
